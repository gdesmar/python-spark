# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.

    steps:
      # Checkout the code as the first step.
      - checkout
      - python/install-packages:
          pkg-manager: pip
          # app-dir: ~/project/package-directory/  # If your requirements.txt isn't in the root directory.
          # pip-dependency-file: test-requirements.txt  # if you have a different name for your requirements file, maybe one that combines your runtime and test requirements.
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          # This assumes pytest is installed via the install-package step above
          command: pytest

    # This is based on your 1.0 configuration file or project settings
    - run: pip install --upgrade setuptools
    - run: pip install -e .

    # Save dependency cache
    - save_cache:
        key: v2-dependencies-{{ .Branch }}-{{ epoch }}
        paths:
        # This is a broad list of cache paths to include many possible development environments
        # You can probably delete some of these entries

        - ~/virtualenvs
        - ~/.m2
        - ~/.ivy2
        - ~/.bundle
        - ~/.cache/bower

    # Test
    #   This would typically be a build job when using workflows, possibly combined with build
    # This is based on your 1.0 configuration file or project settings
    - run: make check
    # Teardown
    #   If you break your build into multiple jobs with workflows, you will probably want to do the parts of this that are relevant in each
