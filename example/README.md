A couple of examples of using SPARK.

Right now both show off the classic expression parsing. `expr` is the simpler
of the two example. It's everything all rolled into one file

`expr2` has more complete grammar rules. And the scanner is split off
from the parser. Down the line we'll probably add a fancier ast evaluation
mechanism distilled from uncompyle6.

If you have better examples please create a github pull request to add the tem.
